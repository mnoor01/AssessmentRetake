I feel that I prepared well for this exam which helped me do well in all the steps and I was
able to completer most of it. But I still have to improve when it comes to fragment because I feel
that I haven;t mastered the concept yet and I feel that I can do more stuff with the recyclerview than I 
think I can. But overall this test has encouraged me to do better.
